* single-instruction-set-computer

This software is an attempt to implement a Single Instruction Set Computer [1],
based on the Subleq example[2] in the Rust programming language. 

(This is primarily as a learning exercise for Rust, but also as an opportunity
to be able to experiment with the implementation once created to explore the
architecture.)

** Implementation Features
- 32k (16 bit) data and address space
- RAM based

** TODO Additional Software
*** Assembler / Dissassember
*** (Reduced) C Compiler
*** Debugger
